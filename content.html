	<h2><u>Response of the Audiene</u></h2>
   <br>
    <section>
      <p>We want our audience to know what is the importance of learning something about first-aids that can help them during bad situations by being able to provide basic care to them or to someone. We also want our audience to be able to perform different procedures depending on the severity of the patient. An example of this is knowing how to correctly perform CPR or Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.</p>

	<h2> <u>First-Aid?</u></h2>
<br>
<p>
It refers to the emergency or immediate care you should provide when a person is injured or ill until full medical treatment is available. For minor conditions, first aid care may be enough. For serious problems, first aid care should be continued until more advanced care becomes available.
